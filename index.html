    									<h3>Women and Men Politicians’ Response to War: Evidence from Ukraine</h3>
 								 </header>
										<p>Does war deepen gender inequalities in politicians’ behavior or help erase them? We draw from the terror management theory developed in psychology to argue that the onset of a violent conflict is likely to push politicians to conform more strongly with traditional gender stereotypes because it helps individuals cope with existential fears. To test our argument, we use data on Ukrainian politicians’ engagement on social media (136,455 Facebook posts by 469 politicians) in the three months before and after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, and interrupted time series analysis, to assess the effect of conflict on politicians’ behavior. We find that conflict onset deepens gender-stereotypical behavior among politicians in their public engagement. We also show that, consistent with our argument, gender biases among the public are magnified during war.</p>

											<h3>Speaking their language?: Multilingualism in party communication across democracies</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Our study examines how political parties navigate linguistic diversity in modern democracies. Naturally, multilingual political communication only emerges in settings where multiple languages are spoken. However, we find that even in multilingual societies, parties don’t always communicate in the languages of all their constituents. This selective approach to language use has important implications for democratic discourse and outcomes, as language barriers can limit political participation and representation. Our research seeks to understand this variation in linguistic representation at the party level.</p>

											<h3>Polarization but not populism strengthens the association between presidential election results and emotions</h3>
										</header>
										<p>We investigate whether election results are associated with emotional reactions among voters across democracies and under what conditions these responses are more intense. Building on recent work in comparative politics, we theorize that emotional intensity is stronger after elections involving populist candidates and highly polarized parties. We test these expectations with a big-data analysis of emotional reactions on parties’ Facebook posts during 29 presidential elections in 26 democracies. The results show that ideological polarization of political parties might intensify emotional reactions, but there is no clear relationship with the presence of populist candidates.</p>

      <h2>About the Project</h2>
    </header>

    <p>
      The Global Political Social Media Project (GPS-POL) is an international research initiative
      dedicated to collecting, preserving, and sharing political social media data across
      democracies. Our goal is to support transparent, reproducible research on political behavior,
      communication, and democratic processes.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Team</h3>
    <p>
      GPS-POL is led by an interdisciplinary team of scholars in political science, psychology,
      and computational social science. The project is based at Washington University in St. Louis
      and collaborates with researchers worldwide.
